## How It Works

The program starts by asking for:
- Your **name**
- Your **starting balance**

It then lists available products with:
- Name, price, quantity
- Shipping info
- Expiry info (if any)

You choose which products to add to your cart.

When you're ready, choose the **"Checkout"** option.
